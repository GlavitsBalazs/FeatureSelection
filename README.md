# Feature Selection
A small implementation of an algorithm that finds [Markov blankets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_blanket).

Dependencies:
- NumPy
- [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) (optional)
  
Files:
- `featselect.py`: the core implementation
- `testing.py`: executable that runs some tests
- `large_bn.bif`: a Bayes network in Bayesian Interchange Format used for testing.
- `large_bn.png`: visual representation of `large_bn.bif`. It's a bit messy.
